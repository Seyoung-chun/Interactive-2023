		  The Japanese colonial period refers to the period in which the Korean peninsula remained as a colony of the Japanese Empire from August 29, 1910. During August 1945, the treaty under which the Japanese Empire annexed Korea was signed and entered into force. During this period, Japan intervened in Korean politics at will, such as killing the queen and dethroning the king. They also extorted resources and slaughtered countless people. As a result of strongly resisting Japanese aggression and exploitation, Korea was able to become independent in 1945 without any help from outside forces. The reason the resistance army succeeded in the independence movement was due to flexible communication and fund management based on relationships. Their unique method of contact played a major role in securing weapons and receiving base funds safely. The main key which leads them to communicate well is the blue bird. In 1910, After Japan colonized Korea, their governing style changed every decade. The first 10 years was called the period of unauthorized rule, also known as the period of military police rule. During this period, the military police were in charge of public security.
