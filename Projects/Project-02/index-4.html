		  In 1920, as a new governor-general from Japan took office, the way Japan governed began to change. They advocated 'cultural rule'. It was also a time when the Japanese Government-General, who was greatly surprised by the March 1st Movement, tried to calm the public sentiment by resolving some of the harsh policies that had been implemented against the Joseon people. The police, not the military police, were in charge of public order, but in 1920, the number of police stations and police officers increased 3.6 times and 3.4 times compared to 1918, and the police budget was more than tripled. In addition, a new high-level police system was established to more viciously monitor society and suppress the independence movement. It seemed that they were pursuing appeasement measures such as abolishing the company ordinance economically and deregulating business in Korea, but in reality, the company establishment conditions were changed from permission system to notification system for the purpose of making it easier for Japanese companies to advance into Korea. Several Korean media outlets, such as the Chosun Ilbo, Donga Ilbo, and Chosun JoongAng Ilbo, were also founded during the period of cultural communication.
