		  The Japanese colonial period refers to the period in which the Korean peninsula remained as a colony of the Japanese Empire from August 29, 1910. During August 1945, the treaty under which the Japanese Empire annexed Korea was signed and entered into force. During this period, Japan intervened in Korean politics at will, such as killing the queen and dethroning the king. They also extorted resources and slaughtered countless people. As a result of strongly resisting Japanese aggression and exploitation, Korea was able to become independent in 1945 without any help from outside forces. The reason the resistance army succeeded in the independence movement was due to flexible communication and fund management based on relationships. Their unique method of contact played a major role in securing weapons and receiving base funds safely. The main key which leads them to communicate well is the blue bird. The existence of the blue bird, which made a great contribution, was known to many. They soon blew a small ceramic whistle to summon the homing pigeon. Blue Bird, timid and wary of strangers, avoided Japanese with unfamiliar accents, so many letters went undetected. The bird soon became a symbol of the Resistance.

		 From the beginning of the 1940s, Japan's global position was at a disadvantage, and it no longer had the strength to face Korea's fierce resistance. The resistance fighters, who did not miss this momentum, spurred the liberation by carrying out more active military and political maneuvers. They devised a way to record Bluebird's sound and spread it nationwide. People can hear it through the gramophone. In addition, they produced a mobile terminal that can send and receive Arirang codes. No more stamps needed. After liberation, secret codes for exchanging military secrets were no longer needed in a peaceful country, so the Bluebird and the Arirang code gradually ceased to be used. However, the blue bird is still loved by Koreans and has become a byword for communication. Communication is not simply delivering messages and messages, but presenting an opportunity to move forward in a hopeless situation. We need to look back on the efforts and numerous inventions that people of old put in to communicate. 100 years have passed, and it is difficult to see blue birds on the streets these days, when many green mountains and trees have disappeared through development. However, many people still have birds in their hearts. These days it seems to call the bird by a different name: Twitter
