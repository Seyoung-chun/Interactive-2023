		  The 1930s was the most severe period of Japanese exploitation. During this time, the Japanese Empire began to carry out the eradication of the nation, and the resistance realized the importance of preserving the national culture and began to carry out the movement to protect the national culture. Armed struggles were also actively developed abroad. Overseas armed struggles during this period were mainly conducted in Manchuria and China. The exchange of voice codes using Blue Bird was successful, but some resistance groups felt uncomfortable in that no records were left. So They visually translated the sound of Bluebird's password. And developed a sheet music to write it down. It’s called Arirang code, the name of the folk song that helped devise the blue bird’s voice code. Also, the visualized code is very similar to the musical notation of the percussion instrument used to sing Arirang. The code was engraved on the seal and then stamped. Thanks to its simplicity and ease of stamping, it has become a favorite of many people.
